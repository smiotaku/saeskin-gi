### 📚 Contribution Rules

To maintain consistency and quality, please follow these rules:

* **Important: Avoid Duplication!** 🔍 Before creating a new issue, **search the Issues page first** to see if the character or design you want has already been submitted. If it has, add a comment to that existing issue instead of creating a new one.
* **Copyright:** 📝 Only use images that are copyright-free or are clearly for non-commercial use. If you are unsure, please provide the image source.
* **PSD Consistency:** 🎨 **Do not** change the layer structure or layer names in the PSD files we provide.
* **Image Quality:** 🖼️ All images used must be high-resolution and not blurry.
